Testing stream insertion operator and constructors...
c1 = ( 23, 34 )
c2 = ( 0, 0 )

Testing get methods...
Real part of c4 = 3
Imaginary part of c4 = 4
Real part of c4 = 3
Imaginary part of c4 = 4

Testing set methods...
New value of c2 = ( 3.7, 2.5 )
New value of c2 = ( -1.4, 2.5 )
New value of c2 = ( -1.4, 83 )

Testing stream extraction operator...
Enter a complex number in the form (a, b) New value of c2 = ( 8, 4 )

Testing addition operator...
c3 = ( 26, 38 )
( 3, 4 ) + ( 23, 34 ) = ( 26, 38 )
( 3, 4 ) + ( 3, 4 ) = ( 6, 8 )

Testing multiplication operator...
c3 = ( -67, 194 )
( 3, 4 ) * ( 23, 34 ) = ( -67, 194 )
( 3, 4 ) * ( 3, 4 ) = ( -7, 24 )

Testing equality operator...
( 23, 34 ) and ( -67, 194 ) are not equal
( 3, 4 ) and ( 3, 4 ) are equal
